Zynthian includes hundreds of effects & filters that you can combine as you like. You can play the music style you want, recreating vintage sounds or exploring new textures. 

The native Zynthian-UI allows you to manage up to 16 independent FX-chains. With the advanced MOD-UI web interface, you can create the more bizarre pedalboards. Limit is in your brain!

Zynthian supports the LV2-plugin standard, so the list of supported effects is ever growing.

The MIDI-learning workflow is quick & easy. You can adjust the parameters you want from your favorite MIDI controller. Buttons/pads (program-change) can be assigned to presets, and knobs/faders (CC) to parameters.

Official Zynthian Kits have 2 balanced audio-inputs with independent gain-control ranging from -12db to 32dB. Read the full specifications [here](/technical-specifications).

Default latency and jitter is low enough for most of players, but if you are looking for extra-low latency, audio configuration can be tweaked.
