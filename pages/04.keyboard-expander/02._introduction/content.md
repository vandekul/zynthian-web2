It can run any LV2 plugin, so the list of Synth Engines & Effects are ever growing.

The amazing (but non-free) Pianoteq physical modeler is supported and a demo version is included. Of course, you can easily upgrade to the licensed version.

The MIDI learning workflow is quick & easy and allows you to manage everything from your MIDI keyboard/controller, or several of them if you like. Program Change (buttons) can be assigned to presets, and CC (knobs) to parameters.

Latency and jitter is low enough.
