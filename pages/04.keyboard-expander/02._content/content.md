Zynthian includes more than 30 synth-engines, hundreds of effects and thousands of presets. You can play the music style you want (classical, jazz, funk, rock, pop, electro), recreating vintage sounds, or explore new sounds and textures by combining several engines and presets, or creating your own presets by adjusting the engine parameters, adding effects and filters, ...

Zynthian supports the LV2-plugin standard, so the list of Synth Engines & Effects is ever growing. The amazing (but non-free) [Pianoteq](https://www.modartt.com/pianoteq?target=_blank) physical modeller is also supported and a demo version is included. Of course, you can easily upgrade to the licensed version.

The MIDI learning workflow is quick & easy, what allows you to manage everything from your MIDI keyboard/controller. Program Change (buttons) can be assigned to presets, and CC (knobs) to parameters.

You can connect several MIDI keyboard/controllers to your zynthian: It has standard MIDI-IN/THRU/OUT connectors and 4 USB ports.

Default latency and jitter is low enough for most of players, but if you are looking for extra-low latency, the configuration can be tweaked for it.
