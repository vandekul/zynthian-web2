## Cookies
This site uses cookies for improving user experience:

+ We use own cookies for implementing the shopping process.
+ We also use external cookies (Google Analytics) for getting statistical information about how this site is being used, so we can improve the right areas and detect malfunction or inefficient design.
<br>

## Personal Data
We collect user data in the contact form:

+ Name
+ Email

and also during the shopping process:

+ Name & Last name
+ Address
+ Email

We need your email for answering your questions and also for sending the order confirmation and status updates. Obviously, we need your name & address for shipping your order. We don't use this data for sending anything unrelated with your questions or orders. 

Sporadicly, we could send you a newsletter with information about the project progress, but not more than 1-2 emails/year. Of course, you can unsubscribe when you want. Simply reply to the undesired email with the word "unsubscribe" and you will be excluded from any future sending.

We don't share this information with anybody. Mailchimp or any other company wont get your personal data from us.

We conserve the data after shipping the order, but if you really want, you can contact with us (sales@zynthian.org) and we will delete your data from our system. We are not specially interested in keeping trace of you.
