## Concept

Zynthian is a new class of musical device. A sonic tool capable of synthetizing amazing sounds, emulating vintage synthesizers or acoustic instruments and processing audio input with countless effects and filters. 
Also, it's a powerful MIDI processor and router, equipped with standard MIDI ports, MIDI-USB and network interfaces.

You can use it for live performing, studio production or as a tool for sound exploration.

Zynthian is a community-driven project and it's 100% open source. Free software on Open hardware. Completely configurable and fully hackable! Free as in Freedom. An Open Platform for Sound Synthesis & Processing.
